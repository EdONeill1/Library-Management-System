# bibliotech

Bibliotech was a library management system done as a project for a Web Development course in University College Dublin. 

I worked on the backend and created many of the foundations of some of the front end when I was implementing features into the backend.

The technologies used were:
* SpringBoot and Java
* Docker
* Pom
